Debugging/performance issues:
- Make sure the audio files match the names in timings.txt
- Include a number at the end of the audio file name in timings.txt corresponds to the order in which it must be played
- Make sure there is only one video file in the video folder
- Each time you run audio_vid_merge.py, the final audio and final output files will be rewritten
